# Money Tracker App (Portfolio Project)

This project was built by me, Gabriel Pato, to have some public code available.
As of now (feb 2024) there is only the front end. All the app data is store locally.

There is a deployed version running [here](https://theduckman-money-tracker.netlify.app).

The next step is to build a back end for this, using NestJS. I'll be working on that in the following weeks.

## ‚ú® Features

### ‚ú® Implemented

- Create, edit and delete expense and income records
- See records grouped by month and categories as lists and charts (pie and bar)

### ‚ú® To do

- Recurring records
- Anual overview
- Subcategories

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech stuff

The app was built using Vue.js version 3 (and using the composition API) and the Vuetify framework. Some packages that were added are listed here:

- Pinia (store)
- VueRouter (routing)
- Maska (input mask)
- Mitt (events)
- Vue Google Charts (ploting charts)
- Lodash

## üí° Usage

Just clone the project, go to the root directory and run

```bash
yarn install
```

then

```bash
yarn dev
```
and the project should be running, locally, in development mode.
